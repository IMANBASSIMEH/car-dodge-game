# Car dodge game

Drive your car with dodging other cars coming towards yours

## Description

You are driving a car in an opposite direction so you will have to dodge other cars.
This is a web project written in Javascript & HTML.
The game screen used canvas and Simple javascript script
The cars' speeds and the new spawn location are random

## Getting Started
When you open the link "http://car-dodge-game.eu5.org"
The cars starts moving towards you and you have to go right (right arrow key or D) or left (left arrow key or A) to dodge them,
and by the time passing without crashing you will get more points. When you crash into another car you will get a message with your final score in it.
That message also have a button to reset the game.

### Installing

You can download both files index.html and sketch.js
I recommend downloading the zip of the project from github with the img folder
There is no additional downloads needed.
Open the index.html file and the program will run locally.

### Executing program

* Open the link "http://car-dodge-game.eu5.org"
* Start moving your car using arrow keys or A and D
* Press 'Play Again' button to restart

## Help

- The game screen might be bigger than your browser screen so I recommend zooming out or playing on fullscreen by pressing f11
- The cars might be near to eachother so its impossible to dodge at the start of the game,
just try again and it will reset.
